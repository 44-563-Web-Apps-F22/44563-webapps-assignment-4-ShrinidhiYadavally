    GIU.   
    When they have chosen two that leaves you plenty—
    Two dozen we, and ye are four-and-twenty.
  
    FIA. 
    and VIT.  
    Till then, enjoy your dolce far niente.
  
    ANT.<br>      
    With pleasure, nobody contradicente!
   
  
    For the merriest fellows are we, tra la,
    That ply on the emerald sea, tra la;
     With loving and laughing,
     And quipping and quaffing,
     We're happy as happy can be, tra la—
     With loving and laughing, etc.
  
     With sorrow we've nothing to do, tra la,
     And care is a thing to pooh-pooh, tra la;
     And Jealousy yellow,
     Unfortunate fellow,
     We drown in the shimmering blue, tra la—
     And Jealousy yellow, etc.
  
     FIA.
     (looking off).
      See, see,
      at last they come to make their
      choice—
      Let us acclaim them with united voice.
  
    (Marco and Giuseppe appear in gondola at back.)
  
     CHORUS
     (Girls).     
     Hail, hail! gallant gondolieri, ben venuti!
     Accept our love, our homage, and our duty.
     Ben' venuti! ben' venuti!
  
    (Marco and Giuseppe jump ashore—the Girls salute them.)
  
     CHORUS (Girls).
     Hail, hail! gallant gondolieri, ben venuti!
     Accept our love, our homage, and our duty.
     Ben' venuti! ben' venuti!
