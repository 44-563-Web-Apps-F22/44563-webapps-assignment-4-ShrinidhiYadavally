  When they have chosen two that leaves you plenty—<br>
  Two dozen we, and ye are four-and-twenty.<br><br>

  SONG—ANTONIO and CHORUS.<br><br>

  For the merriest fellows are we, tra la,<br>
  That ply on the emerald sea, tra la;<br>
   With loving and laughing,<br>
   And quipping and quaffing,<br>
   We're happy as happy can be, tra la—<br>
   With loving and laughing, etc.<br><br>

   With sorrow we've nothing to do, tra la,<br>
   And care is a thing to pooh-pooh, tra la;<br>
   And Jealousy yellow,<br>
   Unfortunate fellow,<br>
   We drown in the shimmering blue, tra la—<br>
   And Jealousy yellow, etc.<br><br>

   FIA.<br>
   (looking off).<br>
    See, see,<br>
    at last they come to make their<br>
    choice—<br>
    Let us acclaim them with united voice.<br>

  (Marco and Giuseppe appear in gondola at back.)<br><br>

   CHORUS<br> 
   (Girls).<br>     
   Hail, hail! gallant gondolieri, ben venuti!<br>
   Accept our love, our homage, and our duty.<br>
   Ben' venuti! ben' venuti!<br><br>

  (Marco and Giuseppe jump ashore—the Girls salute them.)<br><br>

   CHORUS (Girls).<br>
   Hail, hail! gallant gondolieri, ben venuti!<br>
   Accept our love, our homage, and our duty.<br>
   Ben' venuti! ben' venuti!
