    SONG—ANTONIO and CHORUS.<br><br>
  
    For the merriest fellows are we, tra la,<br>
    That ply on the emerald sea, tra la;<br>
     With loving and laughing,<br>
     And quipping and quaffing,<br>
     We're happy as happy can be, tra la—<br>
     With loving and laughing, etc.<br><br>
  
     With sorrow we've nothing to do, tra la,<br>
     And care is a thing to pooh-pooh, tra la;<br>
     And Jealousy yellow,<br>
     Unfortunate fellow,<br>
     We drown in the shimmering blue, tra la—<br>
     And Jealousy yellow, etc.<br><br>
  
     FIA.<br>
     (looking off).<br>
      See, see,<br>
      at last they come to make their<br>
      choice—<br>
      Let us acclaim them with united voice.<br>

     Hail, hail! gallant gondolieri, ben venuti!<br>
     Accept our love, our homage, and our duty.<br>
     Ben' venuti! ben' venuti!<br><br>
